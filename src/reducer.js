      // To learn more about this method click here:

      // [a] get the dispatched id (action.id) of the item
      // whose remove button was just pressed.
      // [b] Check to see if the id of this item,
      // is equivalent to the id of any items
      // that are currently in the basket
      // [c] find the exact location of this item via findindex()
